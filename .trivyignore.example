# Trivy Ignore File Example
# =========================
# This file allows you to ignore specific vulnerabilities that are false positives
# or acceptable risks in your container images.
#
# Usage:
#   1. Copy this file to .trivyignore in your repository root
#   2. Add CVE IDs or vulnerability IDs to ignore
#   3. Trivy will skip these vulnerabilities during scanning
#
# Format:
#   - One vulnerability ID per line
#   - Lines starting with # are comments
#   - Blank lines are ignored
#
# Example: Ignore specific CVEs
# CVE-2021-12345
# CVE-2022-67890
#
# Best Practices:
#   - Always add a comment explaining why a vulnerability is ignored
#   - Regularly review ignored vulnerabilities
#   - Link to tracking issues or security assessments
#   - Consider expiration dates for ignored vulnerabilities
